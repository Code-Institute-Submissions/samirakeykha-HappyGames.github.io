-   ### Testing 
1. For images </img src="assets /images /one.img.jpg" alt="One" />
2. Typing identifiers for correct and incorrect options...... for example: <div id="correct"> 
3. I created an ID named, where to put your boxes:
<//div id="choices">      
                <div id="box1" class="box"> </div>
                <div id="box2" class="box"></div>
                <div id="box3" class="box"></div>
                <div id="box4" class="box"></div>	
            </div>
4. Next, I created three identifiers:  For Start Game <div id="startreset">, for Time remaining:  <div id="timeremaining"> and  for GameOve<div id="gameOver">.
5.To enable JavaScript: <script src="assets /js/script.js"></script>
6. I used these IDs for the design on the page, all of which are in the style.css file.


 <img src="assets /images /17.png" alt="One"  width= "100px" height=" 100px">
 <img src="assets /images /18.png" alt="two" width= "100px" height=" 100px" >
 
 <img src="assets /images /19.png" alt="One"  width= "100px" height=" 100px">
 <img src="assets /images /20.png" alt="two" width= "100px" height=" 100px" >
 


           

## Bugs 
When I entered the html and css codes, I had major problems connecting with the javascript.<script src="assets /js/script.js"></script>And the reason for that problem was because of a distance between them.
